- Issue #1:
  Comparison nodes are likely yielding a lot of application specific stuff.
  Evaluate their usefulness.

  For time being, Sriram turned them off to enable me to evaluate the frequent subgraphs stuff.

- Issue #2:
  The isomorphism extracted need not be a complete ACDFG fragment.
  - For each method node, need to dump the arguments whether or not they are part of the isomorphism.

- Issue #3:
  Because the isomorphism is approximate, there are two possible isomorphisms that are obtained for each
  computation. We should dump them as
   _A.iso.bin and _B.iso.bin files. For the annotator, only one of them is needed.
